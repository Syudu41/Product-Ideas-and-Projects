# Umbra VibeWorks

Umbra VibeWorks is a minimalist light-mode product lab journal: a clean surface to post updates/logs, track what is currently being built, and archive completed projects.

The UI is intentionally restrained (Apple-style): centered document layout, generous negative space, crisp typography (Geist headings + Inter body), subtle lift interactions, and gentle scroll reveal.

## Sections (on the page)
- Updates and Logs
- Current Projects — Work in Progress
- Completed Projects

## Notes
- This is a static site (no React build step), designed to work cleanly on GitHub Pages.
- If you want to edit content, search inside homepage for the section headings above and replace the placeholder entries.
